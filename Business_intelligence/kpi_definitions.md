**Formula**:
```
Efficiency Index = Revenue / (Active Workers + Active Machines)
```

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT SUM(revenue_calculated) FROM extraction 
     WHERE date_extracted BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date) as total_revenue,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM worker) as total_workers,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM machinery WHERE status = 'Active') as active_machines,
    ROUND((SELECT SUM(revenue_calculated) FROM extraction 
           WHERE date_extracted BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date) / 
          ((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM worker) + 
           (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM machinery WHERE status = 'Active')), 2) as efficiency_index
FROM DUAL;
```
